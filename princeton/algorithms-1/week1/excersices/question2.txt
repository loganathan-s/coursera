Give the id[] array that results from the following sequence of 9 union
operations on a set of 10 items using the weighted quick-union algorithm from lecture.

    5-8 5-9 0-4 3-1 9-7 8-6 4-1 7-3 2-3 

Recall: when joining two trees of equal size, our weighted quick union convention is to
make the root of the second tree point to the root of the first tree. Also, our weighted
quick union algorithm uses union by size (number of nodes), not union by height.
